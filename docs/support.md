# Support

At Picstome, we're committed to helping you get the most out of your photography workflow tools. While we're a small team, we offer several ways to get support when you need it.

## Community Support

Our primary support channel is through our community. We believe in the power of open-source collaboration and the knowledge shared among photographers using Picstome.

### GitHub Issues

For bug reports, feature requests, or technical support, please open an issue on our GitHub repository:

[https://github.com/picstome/picstome/issues](https://github.com/picstome/picstome/issues)

When creating an issue, please include:

1. A clear description of the problem or request
2. Steps to reproduce any bugs you're experiencing
3. Screenshots if applicable
4. Information about your environment (PHP version, server details, etc.)

This helps us address your concerns more effectively and benefits the entire community.

## Documentation

Before opening a support ticket, we recommend checking our documentation, which covers most common questions and setup procedures:

- [Installation Guide](./install.md)
- [Feature List](./about.md#full-feature-set)
- [Troubleshooting](./install.md#troubleshooting)

## Support Response Times

As Picstome is maintained by a small team of developers alongside their other responsibilities, please note:

- GitHub issues are typically reviewed within 1-3 business days
- More complex issues may take longer to resolve
- Feature requests are collected and prioritized for future releases
